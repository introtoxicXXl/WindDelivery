        <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">What is One way data binding?</h1>
        <p className="text-base">
          One-way data binding is a concept primarily associated with front-end development and frameworks like  React. It refers to the unidirectional flow of data from the model  to the view in an application.Changes in the applications data model automatically reflect in the UI components that are bound to that model. When the data in the model changes, the corresponding UI elements are updated to reflect those changes. However, in one-way data binding, the flow of data is unidirectional. Changes made in the UI elements generally do not automatically update the underlying data model. Any updates or changes in the UI typically do not propagate back to the original data source unless handled explicitly.</p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">What is NPM in node.js?</h1>
        <p className="text-base">
        NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It's a package manager for Node.js, meaning it's a tool that helps developers manage the libraries, packages, and dependencies used in their Node.js projects.NPM provides a vast registry of reusable code packages/modules that developers can easily integrate into their Node.js projects. These packages can range from simple utility functions to complex frameworks.It simplifies the process of adding, updating, and removing packages, along with their dependencies, by providing commands to handle these tasks effortlessly.NPM uses a configuration file called package.json which resides in the root directory of a Node.js project. This file contains metadata about the project, such as project name, version, dependencies, and other settings. It allows developers to define project-specific configurations and manage dependencies more efficiently. NPM enables developers to define custom scripts in the package.json file, allowing for automation of various tasks like running tests, starting the server, or building the project. These scripts can be executed using simple commands through NPM.</p>

                MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a flexible, document-based data model. It stores data in JSON-like documents, allowing for nested structures and dynamic schemas.

                MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns. It follows a fixed schema with predefined relationships between tables.

                MongoDB uses a query language that is similar to JSON. It supports querying using a rich set of operations on documents, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

                MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language), a powerful language for querying relational databases. SQL provides standard operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, etc.

                MySQL has a rigid schema structure, where tables require a predefined schema with fixed columns and data types. Any changes to the schema may require alterations in existing data.

                MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, enabling scaling by adding more servers or nodes to a cluster. It supports sharding, allowing distribution of data across multiple machines.

                <td className="px-6 py-4">
                MySQL traditionally relies on vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) and replication for scalability. While it supports some degree of horizontal scaling, it's generally less flexible in this regard compared to MongoDB.
